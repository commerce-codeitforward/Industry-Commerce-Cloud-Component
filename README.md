# Industry-Commerce-Cloud-Components

Welcome to Industry Commerce Cloud Components! 
This repository is an open source, community driven, source of reference / sample components for Commerce Cloud on Core. (That is to say B2B and D2C Commerce)

These components are intended for demo purposes only and are designed to show different industry examples that could be implemented. While each developer strives to build the most 'production' ready component as possible to contribute, you should make your own assessment of the components prod-readiness before using them. 
In most cases, you'll be able to hit the ground running with these components and make your own modifications as needed. 

### ⚠️ Disclaimers

- This collection is provided as-is. It's not officially supported by Code It Forward or covered by SLAs.
- Detailed component & functionality documentation is not provided with the collection.
